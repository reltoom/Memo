## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

* Easy to understand what game you will play and how.
* Easy to navigate and start a game.
* Easy to reset the game after winning.

#### Returning Visitor Goals

* Layout is the same as before.
* Trying to beat the game modes faster than before.

## Design

Using the images of my daughters drawings for the game was a deliberate style choice. Each of her pictures had different dimensions(width and heigth) so it was very difficult to adjust the images so they would be centered and show full image. I could have chosen a more fluid or easier to crop image, but I thought having a child's drawing as the art for Kidz Memo would add layer of excitment and wonder for kids. Maybe they could get their drawings into the game?
### Color Scheme

I wanted the color scheme to happy, fun and bright. Something to draw a kids attention to it.
* `Rgba(234, 213, 255, 1)`A light lavender type is used as the primary background color the whole site.
* `Rgba(221, 72, 247, 1)`A shade of purple is used for Links, headers, text for reset button and background for Sound On/Off button.
* `Rgba(254, 252, 71, 1)`A shade of dark yellow is used for the main header background and main text background. It is also the background of the reset button and the text of the Sound On/Off button.
* `Rgba(5, 43, 237, 1)`A shade of royal blue is used for the name of the site, Kidz Memo, and then the text for rules and game modes.

### Typography

One type of font from Google Fonts was used for this site.

* For text, Kidz Memo uses [Permanent Marker](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Permanent+Marker). This seemed like a fun 'marker' style that a kid could use. 

### Future Implementations

1. Add a moves counter to see how many 'turns' it takes to win.
2. Adding a timer to see how long it takes to win a game.
3. Different pictures for the 'cards' and even bigger game area.
4. Get kids to send in their own drawings for Kidz Memo art.

## Testing

Kidz Memo has been tested on: Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari(Reset button does not cover full bottom of page).

With Dev Tools all standard screen sizes were tested to make sure the site looks good and is still readable. 

I had a couple of friends, my brothers, and my daughter test the game and check user error possiblities.

Links in the main menu take the user to correct game modes. Sound On/Off works correctly. Reset Button works correctly by reshuffling the whole game board.

Win message pops up on player completion of a game mode and can be closed.

## Validator Test

* HTML
    * Using the [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input), code was checked for each webpage of Kidz Memo to see if there were any errors. There were no errors.
    ![W3C HTML Test](assets/readmeimages/htmlvalidator.png)
* CSS
    * Using the [W3C Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) the code for CSS was checked for errors, there were none.
    ![W3C CSS Test](assets/readmeimages/cssvalidator.png)
* Javascript
    * Using the [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com/) we analyzed the Javascript code. There are no errors but 17 warnings, most of which are :'let' is available in ES6 (use 'esversion: 6') or Mozilla JS extensions (use moz).
* Accessibility 
    * Using the Lighthouse dev tool from Chrome; accessibitly, performace, best practices and SEO were tested for each page.

### Bugs

Here are some, but not all, of the bugs that were fixed during development. 

| Bug | Fix |
| :--- | :--- |
| Boxes for the game areas not aligning properly | Commented out lines of CSS code and reapplied them one by one. |
| Sound Button not working | Googled javascript code for muting, read several sites and put it into code. Trial and error until it worked. |
| Not being able to close the pop up win message | Googled ways to close a modal pop up and tested several varients.
| Boxes not flipping when clicked | Doubled checked CSS and javascript function to make sure right elements were selected for flipping|

There was alot of back and forth with the writing of several lines of code, saving, running and re-writing. For some functions to work, all 3 elements had to be right, HTML, CSS and Javascript. Rereading course material and Googling that same material to better grasp the concepts was needed. 

There are no unsolved errors.

## Credits

### Code Used

Most of the code I wrote myself with a lot of trial and error, saving and viewing on web browser. 

For the structure of the functions for the game I followed [Paddy Walshes Project](https://github.com/paddyw11/Paddy-walsh-project-2b).

For the modal pop up I followed code from [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp).

Structure for the README file is from my project [Ways to Relax](https://github.com/reltoom/Project-1-Relax) adjusted to fit Kidz Memo.

### Media

Audio clip is from [Free Sound](https://freesound.org/).

Images for the Memo game are drawn by my daughter.
